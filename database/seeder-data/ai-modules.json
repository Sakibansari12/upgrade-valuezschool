The two teams take turns batting and fielding. When it''s a team''s turn to bat, they have two batsmen at the crease. The batsmen have to try and score as many runs as they can. The batsman does this by hitting the ball and running between the two wickets (three stumps with two bails on top). The batsman can score runs by running between the wickets or by hitting the ball to the boundary of the field. When it''s a team''s turn to field, they have to try and get the batsmen out. There are several ways to do this. The most common is to catch the ball after it has been hit by the batsman. The fielder can also get the batsman out by hitting the wickets with the ball. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. It''s a great game to play and watch.",

The second was to chew with her mouth closed. And the third was to never talk with food in her mouth. Tina was so excited to learn these important table manners that she invited her dolls to a grand feast. She prepared a delicious meal of her favorite foods and set the table with her best dishes. When the dolls arrived, they taught Tina the three essential table manners. She was so pleased with herself that she thanked them for teaching her.

Every day, Finny would swim around and explore the river, admiring the bright colors of the fish and plants. One day, Finny noticed something strange in the river. There were some strange things floating in the water that he had never seen before. Finny swam closer and saw that the objects were plastic bags, bottles, and other garbage. Finny was very sad to see the river so polluted. He decided that he had to do something to help. So, he asked his friends to join him in a mission to clean up the river. Finny and his friends worked together to collect the garbage from the river and put it in a big pile on the bank. They then asked the people who lived near the river to help them take the garbage away to be recycled. The people were so impressed with Finny and his friends that they started to take care of the river every day. They picked up garbage whenever they saw it, and they made sure to put it in the right places. Finny and his friends were very proud of what they had done. The river was now clean and full of life again. From then on, Finny and his friends made sure to keep the river clean and healthy. Moral of the story: Everyone can help keep our rivers clean by picking up garbage and putting it in the right places. We all need to do our part to protect our rivers and keep them clean and healthy for future generations.",
